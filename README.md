This Streamlit-based web application predicts diseases like heart attack, asthma, or pneumonia based on user symptoms. The system utilizes a Logistic Regression model trained on a labeled dataset (disease_data.csv). Users input symptoms such as fever, cough, and chest pain via dropdowns, and the model predicts possible conditions. The app features a custom background and intuitive design for a smooth user experience. It also includes error handling for valid input requirements. The trained model is saved and loaded using joblib for efficient deployment.
